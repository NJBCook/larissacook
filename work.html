                        <p>My illustration style is vibrant, bold, and playful. Much of my portfolio is dedicated to celebrating the unique beauty of Australia's flora, fauna, and landscapes.</p>
                        <p>Through product development Iâ€™ve exploring a variety of materials to craft creative and marketable designs. From wooden pins and brooches to fun stickers, prints, and wall hangings, my creations span a diverse range of mediums. You'll also find my artistic touch adorning tote bags, earrings, and even hand-sewn custom printed makeup bags. For those seeking a deeper dive into my world, there's also a fully illustrated artbook to explore - with over 98 animal illustrations.</p>
                        <p>Each of my creations is accompanied by carefully designed packaging, adding that extra touch of delight and charm to every item.</p>
