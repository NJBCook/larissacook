              My illustration style is vibrant, bold, and playful. Much of my
              portfolio is dedicated to celebrating the unique beauty of
              Australia's flora, fauna, and landscapes.

              Through product development Iâ€™ve exploring a variety of materials
              to craft creative and marketable designs. From wooden pins and
              brooches to fun stickers, prints, and wall hangings, my creations
              span a diverse range of mediums. You'll also find my artistic
              touch adorning tote bags, earrings, and even hand-sewn custom
              printed makeup bags. For those seeking a deeper dive into my
              world, there's also a fully illustrated artbook to explore - with
              over 98 animal illustrations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each of my creations is accompanied by carefully designed
              packaging, adding that extra touch of delight and charm to every
              item.

              As a designer, I believe storytelling lies at the core of
              branding. It begins with attentive listening to clients' needs,
              grasping their fundamental values, and comprehending how they
              engage with their audience. These elements form the cornerstone of
              any branding initiative, whether it's a comprehensive brand
              overhaul or targeted marketing campaigns. Regardless of the scale,
              it all boils down to crafting a compelling narrative. As a
              designer, I collaborate closely to create visuals that seamlessly
              align with and enhance that narrative.

              Inspired by the cadence of design thinking, empathize, define,
              create, prototype, test, and implement, I meticulously guide each
