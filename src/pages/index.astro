          Iâ€™m Larissa Cook, an illustrator and designer living in a rural town
          located in the Snowy Mountains NSW, Ngarigo Country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Living in this beautiful part of the country has heavily inspired my
          illustrations and subject matter. Drawing from Australian flora and
          fauna, with a special nod to my magpie neighbors, my work is a vibrant
          celebration of our unique environment. Infusing joy into every piece
          and design, with a dash of playfulness and plenty of boldness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the digital canvas, I'm fueled by a passion for storytelling,
          funky design, crafting memorable customer experiences that surprise
          and delight, all while grooving to the beats of a boogilicious disco
          playlist.

          I thrive on crafting pieces that ignite for customers and the thrill
          of seeing one of my creations find a new home. Each item I create has
          a unique story, with hidden details waiting to be discovered.
        </p>

          In 2018, I dipped my toes into the vibrant market scene and I was
          utterly captivated. Being a small town girl I was over the moon to
          connect with people, engage in creative conversations, and be
          overwhelmed by the genuine affection shown for my artwork. Designing
          exhibition spaces is my playground. I relish the challenge of creating
          spaces with mega disco ball vibes, leaving a lasting impression on
          every visitor.
